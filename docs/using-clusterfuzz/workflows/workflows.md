# Workflows

When ClusterFuzz finds an error, usually referred to as a crash, it also stores
and reports detailed information that can be used to triage the issue.

Rather than try to document all of the data ClusterFuzz provides, this set of
documents details some common workflows. Other tips are provided for making
sense of anything that might not be clear at first glance.

## Other tips

* When viewing a page in the ClusterFuzz web application, you can usually hover
  over an item or field (e.g. "Crash State" on the testcase details page) to see
  a more detailed explanation.
